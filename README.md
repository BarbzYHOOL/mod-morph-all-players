# mod-MorphAll-command-AzerothCore
Morph All custom command for AzerothCore 3.3.5  
It loops through all active sessions and change display id of every online player.
I made it mostly for learning purposes.  
  
Usage: With Admin account, type: .allmorph 999 (this will morph all players into a crab)
